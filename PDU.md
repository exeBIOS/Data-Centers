# PDU
## What is a PDU ?

A PDU or Power Distributed Unit is a Strong current component that acts like a multiplug but often has more advanced features that better fits the components plugged on it.
For example: 
- Equipements including servers, switchs, firewall, etc... are sensible. If you are working in a rack with servers connected to a regular multi plug, the risk is that you might un plug it by accident. PDUs has a security that allows the cables to "clips" in the socket.

- 1 PDU can also be equipped with dual electric channels, again IT equipements are very sensible in most advanced Digital infrastructures there are a minimum of two seperate electric networks. The PDU is basically plugged on both networks. This allows professionnal equipements that are equipped with dual power supplys to be plugged on 1 PDU but to both electrical networks.

- PDUs can also be equipped with thier personal circuit breaker.

## What sockets ?

PDUs are not equipped with the regular sockets you can find in your house. They are equipped with an international socket called (in the majority of PDUs) C13, C14, C19 and C20

C13 and C14 are the most commun sockets present on PDUs. They are used to connect Switches, Servers, Firewall, etc... (10amps) C13 is a Female connecter and C14 is the male version.

C19 and C20 are less present on PDUs they are used fore equipements that need a really high power capacity (16amps). C19 is a female connecter and C20 is the male version.
