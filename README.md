## What is a Datacenter ?

A datacenter is a place used to store data. This is the place where you fill find Network equipement like switches, Optical and copper hubs but mainly servers and firewall.

### What is a server (trust me you have no clue)
A server is a device that's principale job is to serve clients. A server can be a rackable server so it's easy to implement in a rack or just a regular desktop computer. A server usually has an application delivering a service like DNS, Storage, Emails, etc...
There are thousands even millions of different services you could implement on a server. Example PCA wants to send an email to PCB instead of connecting the two computers together, you will implement PCC wich will act like a server PCA will send the message to PCC and PCC will send the message to PCB.

Let's take a less technical example to explain this nonsens above.

When you go to a restaurant and sit at a table you dont go into the kitchens and take the food. A person comes to you and gives you menus to order food that the chef is trained to do, he is called a waiter. Compare the waiter to a Server he is a regular human just like you (a server can be a regular device) the waiter is trained to serv you food (the application is called food). The waiter is not trained to serv you car componets like a person working in a car garage.
